    "There are many reasons why people decide to relocate, e.g. job offers, weather conditions, relationships and etc. Moving to another city, people still want to feel at home. That is why it is important to find the same conditions for living and choose a house with similar places next to it that people used to visit before they moved. So, the main beneficiaries of this problem solution are considered to be people who are willing to relocate for some reasons and to find comparable urban environment at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use several data science approaches and tools to find out the best places for relocation to New York for people from Toronto. To reduce the amount of computation power used we will explore one borough in each city. As our example task we can consider the following situation: there is a very successful trader who lives in Downtown of Toronto and who got a job offer from one of the best firms of Wall Street, and now he has to decide which Manhattan neighborhood to choose to move to.

    "1. This system shouldn't be restricted by two possible cities. It could be a good idea to start with one of the region and then to expand it to a country level or higher.\n",
    "2. While making a decision about a place to relocate to, the system should take into account not only the information about the venues of the neighborhoods but also the data about real estate prices, crime rate, level of noise and etc.\n",
    "3. For this project, it is also a good idea to standardized venue categories and use their variety to make the results more accurate, because in our analysis we had to drop some venue categories reduced their number to 143 although there were initially 279 and 181 different venue categories in Manhattan and Downtown Toronto, correspondingly."

    "To describe each neighborhood in these boroughs, the data about venues next to and within these neighborhoods was extracted from Foursquare database. One of the Downtown Toronto neighborhoods then was chosen as the initial one where we suppose our trader lives. To match Manhattan and Downtown Toronto neighborhoods it was necessary to standardize their descriptions. After standardizing descriptions of neighborhoods by dropping unequal venue categories, there was a clustering stage which helped to divide all the neighborhoods including the initial one into five clusters. The cluster containing the initial neighborhood became a target one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This target cluster provides the trader from the example task with the information that can help him to make a better final decision on choosing the place to relocate faster."
