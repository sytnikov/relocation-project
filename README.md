# Relocation to another city 

## Summary

In this project, we address the challenge of identifying the ideal location for individuals looking to relocate from their hometown, with a specific focus on those considering a move from Toronto, Canada to New York, USA. However, the insights and methodologies developed in this project are applicable to a wide range of relocation scenarios.

People choose to relocate for various reasons, such as job opportunities, climate preferences, and personal relationships, among others. When moving to a new city, it's crucial to find a place that provides a sense of familiarity and offers proximity to the places and amenities they are accustomed to. As a result, this project is primarily aimed at individuals planning to relocate and seeking a comparable urban environment.

The project leverages various data science techniques and tools to identify the most suitable neighborhoods for those considering a move to New York from Toronto. To streamline the computational process, we focus on one borough in each city. To illustrate the approach, let's consider a specific scenario: imagine a successful trader currently residing in Downtown Toronto, who has received a job offer from a Wall Street firm. This individual now faces the task of selecting the most appropriate Manhattan neighborhood for their relocation.
